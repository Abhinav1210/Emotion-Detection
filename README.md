# Emotion-Detection
It is a deep learning model that takes live video from the webcam and predicts the expression of the people in front of it using the model.</br>
Used Transfer Learning to train the model and get an accuracy of 92%. </br>

### Files in this repository </br>
This Neural Network for Emotion Detection.ipynb is for data_preprocessing ,defining the model and training the model
Detect Face for Recognition.ipynb takes live video from the webcam and predict the facial expression of the people using Haar Cascade Classifier by first localising the face and then feeding the cropped image to the trained model.
